#Chat Functionality
This is a package which adds chat functionality to the application.
 ### This is not for public consumption yet and in testing phase ###

 Just render a template called 'chatBox' where ever you want the chat feature to appear.
 It will show list of all users and also mark which users are online.


 #Roadmap
 * Optimize publish - subscribe
 * support for user pics
 * generic rendering(right now class name is hard coded and app has to take care for that)
